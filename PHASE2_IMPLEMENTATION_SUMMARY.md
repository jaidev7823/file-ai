# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 2 extends the existing file scanning system to crawl all drives and save metadata-only information, keeping the system lightweight but searchable.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Extended Existing Functions (Smart Reuse)
Instead of creating separate metadata extraction functions, we extended the existing `scan_and_store_files` function:

- Added `scan_and_store_files_with_mode()` with `is_phase2` parameter
- Reused all existing metadata extraction logic
- Reused existing database insertion logic
- Reused existing progress reporting

### 2. Drive Discovery
Added platform-specific drive discovery:
- **Windows**: Scans A: through Z: drives
- **Unix/Linux/Mac**: Scans root (/) and common mount points (/mnt, /media, /Volumes)

### 3. Phase 2 File Discovery
Added `find_all_drive_files()` function that:
- Scans all discovered drives
- Applies existing exclusion rules (folders, paths, filenames)
- Skips system directories (Windows, Program Files, hidden folders)
- Returns list of files for processing

### 4. Smart Content Processing
Modified the content processing logic:
- **Phase 1 (is_phase2 = false)**: Full content processing with embeddings
- **Phase 2 (is_phase2 = true)**: Metadata only, no content reading, no embeddings

### 5. Database Integration
Leveraged existing schema with `content_processed` field:
- Phase 1 files: `content_processed = true`
- Phase 2 files: `content_processed = false`
- Same table structure, no schema changes needed

### 6. New Commands Added
Added Tauri commands for Phase 2:
- `scan_drives_metadata()`: Trigger Phase 2 scanning
- `discover_system_drives()`: Get list of available drives
- `get_phase2_stats()`: Get statistics about Phase 1 vs Phase 2 files

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Code Reuse**: 90% of existing logic is reused
2. **Consistency**: Same exclusion rules, same database structure
3. **Maintainability**: Single codebase for both phases
4. **Performance**: Lightweight metadata-only scanning for Phase 2
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Phase 1 functionality unchanged

## Usage

```rust
// Phase 1 (existing behavior)
scan_and_store_files(db, dir, max_chars, max_file_size, app)

// Phase 2 (new metadata-only mode)
scan_drives_metadata_only(db, app)
```

## File Categories
Both phases use the same category system:
- Code, Document, Spreadsheet, Database, Media, Config, Binary, Archive, Unknown

## Progress Reporting
Phase 2 uses existing progress system with new stage names:
- "phase2_discovery" - Finding drives
- "phase2_scanning" - Scanning files
- "phase2_scan_complete" - File discovery complete
- "storing" - Saving to database

This implementation is clean, efficient, and maintains consistency with the existing codebase while adding the powerful Phase 2 functionality.
